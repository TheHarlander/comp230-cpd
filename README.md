# Weekly Reports




##Week 1
This is the first week back after the summer holidays. I was quite nervous about coming back after having a hard first year. Monday was an induction, well more of an informal meet and greet after the summer, we got a brief overview of the first semester as we knew the majority of things to look for on the learning space anyway. We also got given a new laptop for our work which is pretty neat even though i still haven't got it working yet. Me and Milly have decided we are going to work together on the production task and have decided on a rowing simulator with a hint of dumb ways to die to make it an interesting experience to say the least.
Thursday was a lecture on how graphics cards render images and we also started to look at open gl, this had me a bit startled jumping straight into new programming, i'm hoping i’ll have time to keep up with this.
Friday was our first lecture with our new lecturer, he seems like a great guy and his engagement with the class is great. It might because milly wasn't there but i was able to keep engaged for the whole 3 hours.


Overview of the week: I started off dreading coming in as i thought i’d be blown away with the tasks but after hearing out the tasks i feel like i might just be able to keep up.


##Week 2 
Second week back at uni and i’m starting to realise that I’m really not good enough at programming giving some severe downs right now. I think if I didn't spend the time over summer learning the basics of C++ i really would of been screwed this year. I forgot to fill in anything after this part so my improvement would be to try and write the weekly report every wednesday and saturday so i can get a more detailed weekly report.


##Week 3
This week I was ill and was house bound the majority of the time, this gave me time to work on my essay in bed however and managed to get a very first draft out already. Me and milly also spent monday on UDK getting the level design out of the way and talking about what we want in the game and so on, i also spent about 4 hours watching UDK tutorials as i’ve never used the programme before. On thursday i made it into lecture even though i was still feeling ill, we looked at transforming the triangle and using keyboard input to move around the screen, sadly my pc was updating so i wasn't able to try it although i did watch other people do it.


##Week 4 
I finished my very first draft last week and had someone review it, it came back and i had the same mistakes as I did last year. This could be an improvement i could make where i need to look over past works comments and review my own work based on these past remarks to find faults in my own work.


##Week 5
This week I made a big improvement in my knowledge of udk and the programming in it, i followed along these tutorials and at the start when she was going through it, it was a little crazy but the more i watched the more i understood as i did it myself. It was a shame that i had to work through the whole base of UDK instead of being able to jump into it but now it is done i should be able to focus solely on programming in UDK. next steps are to watch UDK C++ tutorials. 


##Week 6
I finally completed the battery tutorial for UDK, it was rather satisfying to complete it and to have something to show for it, the next day i went to implement it into the group project but had difficulty concentrating and did not progress far. I then spent 2 days following an openGL tutorial on youtube and was really engaged with it and managed to get a 3d object that is rotating.  I find that when i have something to do and i actually progress doing it i really enjoy programming, so i think i will need to structure a working sheet so i have something i can do constantly and keep my work productivity up.


##Week 7 
This week i was trying to improve on my open gl but i'm finding it very very hard to do. I seem to not understanding the basics of opengl so trying to find more tutorials will be best right now.
Week8 7th-11th
This week I deducted that I needed to read more, we also decided for definite on our vr project. The sheer number of articles we are supposed to read seem to be forgotten by me straight away which makes things harder when i need to remember them in the future.


##Week 9
On monday we spent 3 hours discussing professionalism and morality and such, I did not find this interesting so I did not contribute to the talk instead I worked on my essay and got a couple hundred words done. I also then finished that essay and almost finished one of my research journals the next day, I found it hard to refine what I want to find so a next step would be to research how to properly search for things through google scholar and the IEE library. Also I need to start working more on my programming as i am starting to struggle. Maybe have 1 or 2 days a week where i work on programming that is unrelated to the course, although finding what I should do will be the hard part.


##Week 10 
This week has been pretty intense, I’ve been working everyday some days stretching up to 10 hours trying to get the programming parts to work with no result. Luckily i managed to get the collab project of the floor with my spawning volume and moving cats. Opengl is still too hard for me and i was unable to get anything other than the base tutorial at the moment. This week I’ve decided i like essays more as i can just beast them out in a couple days so my goal for next semester is to see what essays i have to do and start them early so i can have my major focus on the programming parts and hopefully not fail as hard. Nearing the end of the first semester and I can say without a doubt i want to be on this course but i really need to spend more time on programming as it feels i am just doing the work instead of learning it.


##Week 11
This is the final week to work on all the main projects so it's been a very long and tedious one. Me na milly have been getting a base game out the way and it’s come along quite well for the short amount of time we’ve been able to work on it. The main problem we had was source control, in this we first couldn't get it to work with github. So we went to use perforce couldn't get that one to work either, and then we found out about lfs which allowed us to then get the gitignore to work as well. One improvement I could improve on is spending time on tutorials and reading up on github and git shell to improve my knowledge of things such as branching and merging. It turned friday and the arduinos still didn't come and now we find out we need to write a short report on it instead, this was rather annoying. Although I don’t mind reports as much anymore giving us 3 days to research and write it out is harsh even though i know it's not our lecturers fault.




##Week 12 
Monday was the most stressful i have ever felt, this was because our submission wasn't uploading to git hub first of all because of the umap, then it was corrupted. After we uploaded it we tried downloading the zip and it was only 5mb and when built it did not even work so we had to put the whole thing into a zip ourselves and it still was too big. We then decided we had to delete a load of folders from the actual game folder so the water lost its textures and such but we managed to upload a working version to learningspace in the end which is all that matters. With this uploaded and all the other things i uploaded i can say that i am very unhappy with the work i’ve done, I feel like I haven't actually learnt this semester more just done things just to pass and this makes me very sad. I’m hoping that next semester i can focus on learning more and hopefully start to understand more what is taught in the semester.
